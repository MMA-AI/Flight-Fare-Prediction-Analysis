# Overview

This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

# Motivation

What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

# Installation

If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
